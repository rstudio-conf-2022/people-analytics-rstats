## Overview

The course will cover some of the most commonly used methods of analysis and inference when working with data related to people, such as survey data and organizational network data. Among other things, you will learn about:
Typical analyses conducted on people data
Common people-related data types 
Common hypothesis testing methods
Common explanatory modeling methods
How to use graphs to model network relationships 
How to analyze and draw inferences about people networks
You will learn by working through code and data examples with instructors and faculty, including a final data project where you will have a chance to put all your learning into practice.

## Learning objectives

[ADD AN ITEMIZED LIST OF LEARNING OBJECTIVES.]

## Is this course for me?

This course will be valuable to you if: 
 
- You currently work or intend to work in a people-related discipline 

- You have a basic working knowledge of R and RStudio, 

- You are interested in learning applied statistical methods that are commonly used to understand and draw conclusions about the skills, behaviors and attitudes of people and groups.  
 
The course is ideal for someone who is likely to study quantitative social science disciplines to an advanced level, as well as those working in quantitative Human Resources roles in organizations.

## Prework
