```

In this document we will practice various types of network analyses using an edgelist of dolphins

## Exercise 1 - Basic graph summary metrics

```{r}
# Download the dolphin dataset from the URL provided
url <- "https://ona-book.org/data/dolphins.csv"

dolphin_edgelist <- read.csv(url)

# look at the data to see what you're dealing with
```

```{r}
# create an undirected graph
library(igraph)
dolphin_graph <- igraph::graph_from_data_frame(
  dolphin_edgelist,
  directed = FALSE
)
```

```{r}
# View the graph object - how many vertices and edges are there?
dolphin_graph
```


```{r}
# what is the distance between Zig and Fork
distances(dolphin_graph, weights = NULL)["Zig","Fork"]

```

```{r}
# How large is the network?
vcount(dolphin_graph)
ecount(dolphin_graph)
```


```{r}
# Is this a dense network?
edge_density(dolphin_graph)
```

```{r}
# How many components are in this network?
components(dolphin_graph)

# What does this mean for our network?
# we have a complete graph where all dolphins are somehow connected
```

```{r}
# What is the network diameter? What does this mean?
diameter(dolphin_graph)

```

```{r}
# how large is the largest clique?
clique_num(dolphin_graph)

# how many cliques are between size 3 and 5?
length(cliques(dolphin_graph, min = 3, max = 5))
```

## Exercise 2 - Centrality measures

```{r}
# Continuing with our same dolphin graph, which dolphin is an important connector?
cent <-
  dolphin_graph |>
  tidygraph::as_tbl_graph() |>
  dplyr::mutate(
    DEGREE_CENT = tidygraph::centrality_degree(),
    BTWN_CENT = tidygraph::centrality_betweenness(),
    CLOSE_CENT = tidygraph::centrality_closeness()
  )

# SN100 has highest between centrality
cent %>%
  dplyr::arrange(
    desc(BTWN_CENT)
  )

# Which dolphin has the most connections?  (Grin)
cent %>%
  dplyr::arrange(
    desc(DEGREE_CENT)
  )

# Which dolphin has the most central? (SN100)
cent %>%
  dplyr::arrange(
    desc(CLOSE_CENT)
  )

```

```{r}
# plot the dolphin graph and locate Grin and SN100 to see if these results make intuitive sense
V(dolphin_graph)$highcent <- ifelse(V(dolphin_graph)$name %in% c("SN100","Grin"),1,0)

ggraph::ggraph(dolphin_graph) +
  geom_edge_link(color = "grey") +
  geom_node_point(aes(color = as.factor(highcent), size = 3), show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("lightblue","pink")) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name)) +
  theme_void()

```


## Exercise 3: Community detection

```{r}
# What communities do you see in the dolphin graph? Try out a couple of methods and compare results
# e.g. cluster_louvain, cluster_leiden, cluster_fast_greedy
set.seed(123)
communities <- cluster_louvain(dolphin_graph)
V(dolphin_graph)$community <- membership(communities)

sizes(communities)

```

```{r}
# plot your favorite option
set.seed(123)
ggraph(dolphin_graph, layout = "fr") +
  geom_edge_link(color =  "grey") +
  geom_node_point(aes(color = as.factor(community)),
                  show.legend = FALSE) +
  theme_void()
```

## Exercise 4 - Do people tend to email with people in their same department?

```{r}
# Download the email dataset from the URL provided
url <- "https://ona-book.org/data/email_edgelist.csv"

email_edgelist <- read.csv(url)

# Download the corresponding department mappings from the URL provided
url_v <- "https://ona-book.org/data/email_vertices.csv"

email_dept <- read.csv(url_v)

# look through the edges and vertices to understand the data source
```

```{r}
# create the graph with vertice labels
email_graph <- igraph::graph_from_data_frame(
  email_edgelist,
  directed = FALSE,
  vertices = email_dept
)

# Calculate assortativity
assortativity_nominal(email_graph, factor(V(email_graph)$dept))
```

## Exercise 5 - Exploring the friends graph (EXTENSION)

```{r}
# Download the friends dataset from the URL provided
url <- "https://ona-book.org/data/friends_tv_edgelist.csv"

friends_edgelist <- read.csv(url)
```

```{r}
# which two characters interact most?
friends_edgelist |>
  dplyr::arrange(desc(weight))

# is this a connected network?
friends_graph <-
  igraph::graph_from_data_frame(
    friends_edgelist,
    directed = FALSE
  )

components(friends_graph)

# who is the most "important" character?
c_vals <-
  friends_graph |>
  tidygraph::as_tbl_graph() |>
  dplyr::mutate(
    DEGREE_CENT = tidygraph::centrality_degree(),
    BTWN_CENT = tidygraph::centrality_betweenness(),
    CLOSE_CENT = tidygraph::centrality_closeness()
  )

# Ross and Joey come out on top of all metrics
c_vals |>
  dplyr::arrange(desc(DEGREE_CENT))

c_vals |>
  dplyr::arrange(desc(BTWN_CENT))

c_vals |>
  dplyr::arrange(desc(CLOSE_CENT))

```

```{r}
# Are the friends part of the same community?  Who else is in the community?  
# Does it make intuitive sense (if you're a friends fan :-) )

set.seed(123)
communities <- cluster_louvain(friends_graph, weights = NULL)
V(friends_graph)$community <- membership(communities)

membership(communities)[c("Joey","Monica","Chandler","Ross","Phoebe","Rachel")]

# is anyone else in cluster 5?  so many random people....
length(membership(communities)[membership(communities) == 5])

# try leiden
set.seed(123)
communities <- cluster_leiden(friends_graph, weights = NULL)
V(friends_graph)$community <- membership(communities)

membership(communities)[c("Joey","Monica","Chandler","Ross","Phoebe","Rachel")]

# this list of people makes a lot more sense to a Friends fan
membership(communities)[membership(communities) == 49]
```
