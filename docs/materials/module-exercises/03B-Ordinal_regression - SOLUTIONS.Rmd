```

In this document we will conduct ordinal logistic regression on fictional data on employee performance evaluation metrics for a group of salespeople. 

  - sales: annual sales of the individual in millions of dollars
  - new_customers: number of new customers acquired by individual
  - region: region individual works in (North, South, East, West)
  - gender: gender of individual
  - rating: performance rating of individual (1 = Low, 2 = Middle, 3 = High)

## Exercise 1 - Running a simple ordinal logistic regression model

```{r}
# Download the employee performance dataset from the URL provided
url <- "https://peopleanalytics-regression-book.org/data/employee_performance.csv"
perf <- read.csv(url)

```

```{r}
# view the first few rows in the data set to acquaint yourself with the data
head(perf)

summary(perf)
```

```{r}
# What do you think the datatypes are?
# sales: numeric
# new_customers: numeric
# region: factor
# gender: factor
# rating: ordered factor
```


```{r}
# Perform any necessary datatype adjustments
perf$region <- as.factor(perf$region)
perf$gender <- as.factor(perf$gender)
perf$rating <- ordered(perf$rating,
                       levels = 1:3)
```

```{r}
# Take a look at the pairs plot. What do you notice?
GGally::ggpairs(perf)

# Things you might notice are:
# rating seems to be pretty well aligned with sales amount and new customer count
# looks like a lower proportion of women in North and West?
```

```{r}
# Run a simple ordinal logistic regression model to understand sales influence
# on rating, saving your model using a name of your choice
model <- polr(formula = rating ~ sales, data = perf)
model
```



## Exercise 2 - Interpreting the coefficients

```{r}
# Examine the coefficients of your saved model
summary(model)$coefficients

```

```{r}
# Add p-alues and odds rations, and view
# What do you notice?
coefficients <- summary(model)$coefficients
# calculate p-values
p_value <- (1 - pnorm(abs(coefficients[ ,"t value"]), 0, 1))*2
# bind back to coefficients
coefficients <- cbind(coefficients, p_value)
# take exponents of coefficients to find odds
odds_ratio <- exp(coefficients[ ,"Value"])
# combine with coefficient and p_value
(coefficients <- cbind(coefficients[ ,c("Value", "p_value")],odds_ratio))


```
Write a sentence on the model results above.

Each additional million dollars in sales leaders to a 55% increase in odds of being in the next highest performance group.


```{r}
# Do you think this is a good model?  Use the lipsitz test.
DescTools::PseudoR2(model)

generalhoslem::lipsitz.test(model)
```
Write a sentence on the results of this test.

Since the null hypothesis is the model is a good fit and our p-value is very low, we can conclude that this model isn't a good fit for our data.

## Exercise 3 - Add more information to the model

```{r}
# Let's try a model to see how sales, new_customers, and gender impact rating
model2 <- polr(rating ~ sales + gender + new_customers, data = perf)

summary(model2)
```

```{r}
# Add p-alues and odds rations, and view
# What do you notice?
coefficients <- summary(model2)$coefficients
# calculate p-values
p_value <- (1 - pnorm(abs(coefficients[ ,"t value"]), 0, 1))*2
# bind back to coefficients
coefficients <- cbind(coefficients, p_value)
# take exponents of coefficients to find odds
odds_ratio <- exp(coefficients[ ,"Value"])
# combine with coefficient and p_value
(coefficients <- cbind(coefficients[ ,c("Value", "p_value")],odds_ratio))
```

Write a few sentences on the results of the model.

Each additional $1 million in sales results in a 46% increase in odds of being in the next highest performance group.
Each additional new customer results in a 48% increase in odds of being in the next highest performance group.

```{r}
# Do you think this is a good model?
DescTools::PseudoR2(model2)

generalhoslem::lipsitz.test(model2)
```

Write a sentence on the results of the Lipsitz test.

Our p-values is now > 0.05, so we do not reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the model is a good fit.


# Exercise 4: Test the proportional odds assumption

```{r}
# First try the method where we compare the binary models to each other and use
# our judgement
perf$rating23 <- ifelse(perf$rating %in% c(2,3), 1, 0)
perf$rating3 <- ifelse(perf$rating == 3, 1, 0)

mod_23 <- glm(
  rating23 ~ sales + gender + new_customers, data = perf, family = "binomial"
)

mod_3 <-glm(
  rating3 ~ sales + gender + new_customers, data = perf, family = "binomial"
)

(coefficient_comparison <- data.frame(
  mod_23 = summary(mod_23)$coefficients[ , "Estimate"],
  mod_2 = summary(mod_3)$coefficients[ ,"Estimate"],
  diff = summary(mod_3)$coefficients[ ,"Estimate"] - 
    summary(mod_23)$coefficients[ , "Estimate"]
))
```

Using your best judgement, do you think the proportional odds assumption is met?

These differences seem quite small, I would say that the assumption is met.

```{r}
# Alternatively with the Brant-Wald test
# What do you  notice?
library(brant)
brant::brant(model2)

```

Write your interpretation of the brant-wald test results.

The test shows that the assumption holds.  Sales is the only potentially problematic variable.  We could try removing that from our model.
